physical chemistry.\nPhysical chemistry (or abbreviated PC) is an interdisciplinary science at the frontier between chemistry and physics, whose topics go beyond the classical areas of the respective individual sciences and can be divided into the five core subdisciplines of thermodynamics, kinetics, electrochemistry, spectroscopy and  quantum chemistry.\nWhile preparative chemistry focuses on questions of the methodology of chemical synthesis of known and new substances, physical chemistry attempts to describe the properties of substances and their transformation by applying concepts of physics to objects of chemistry by means of theoretical and experimental methods.\nAlong with organic and inorganic chemistry, physical chemistry therefore represents one of the three key disciplines of "classical" chemistry, since it provides the theoretical basis for technical chemistry and process engineering.\nIts knowledge is also an integral part of many other disciplines and is used, for example, for description and understanding in biology and medicine, meteorology as well as the earth sciences.'),(0,i.kt)("p",null,(0,i.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},(0,i.kt)("em",{parentName:"strong"},"Type & planning of experiments:"))),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"The working methods of a physical chemist vary significantly depending on the (main) research area and range from classical thermodynamic and kinetic measurements to electrochemical or spectroscopic investigations and purely computer-based quantum mechanical calculations.\nThe type of experiments to be performed or that can be performed is also largely determined by the sample type and quantity, its characteristics (e.g. state of aggregation, stability, etc.) and the properties to be analyzed.\nAn essential task of a physical chemist is thus, before starting the actual investigations, to first evaluate through extensive and detailed literature research, which measurements are possible or necessary in order to obtain the desired information, taking into account the available resources (e.g. equipment, time schedule, etc.).\nOnce the design of the experiment is complete, the next step is to prepare the sample for the subsequent measurement (e.g. dissolving it in a special solvent, setting a suitable sample concentration, adding other substances necessary for the investigation, etc.) and then to find the best possible measurement conditions for the particular sample.\nHere, it is common practice to perform the same measurement with different parameters (e.g. temperature change) or to repeat it several times under the same conditions in order to subsequently perform an error analysis and thus be able to indicate measurement uncertainties in the result.\nThis is followed by a more or less sophisticated and time-consuming analysis of the measurement, although in many cases it is only by combining several different measurement methods and interpreting the individual results in the context of other experiments that the desired information can be obtained and well-founded scientific
