# Data Steward

A data steward can take on various roles, many times depending on their exact position within an organization or project and their personal set of skills and background. Classically, a data steward is involved in curating data in datasets, assuring the data quality. Data quality can be traced back to the [FAIR Data Principles](../40_topics/01_fair.mdx).

In academia, data stewards have taken on a broad set of tasks. Overall, their aim coincides with the classical definition, meaning, they assist researchers in ensuring that their data is as FAIR as possible. This may may involve defining appropriate [repositories](../40_topics/20_repositories.mdx) for [data publication](../30_data/60_data_publication.mdx), consulting on [data formats](../40_topics/40_format_standards.mdx) and [metadata](../40_topics/30_metadata.mdx) standards, setting up metadata management systems, e.g. through an [electronic laboratory notebook (ELN)](../40_topics/10_eln.mdx), and training researchers on [best practices](../40_topics/60_best_practice.mdx). They may work directly at an institute, but in Germany, many data stewards are part of larger collaborative projects such as [Collaborative Research Centers](https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/coordinated_programmes/collaborative_research_centres/) or even part of various NFDI consortia. They may take on the role of communicating the research community's needs and requirements, enabling developers at IT centers, university libraries, ELN providers, and the NFDI to create tailored solutions.

In Chemistry, data stewards can advise researchers on best practices and journal requirements when publishing their data. Many journals in chemistry are updating their data policies (see for example [Royal Society of Chemistry Data Sharing Guidelines](https://www.rsc.org/journals-books-databases/author-and-reviewer-hub/authors-information/prepare-and-format/data-sharing/)) and increasingly requesting [data sharing](../30_data/60_data_publication.mdx) and [data availability statements](../40_topics/120_data_availability_statement.mdx). Data stewards may help tie in infrastructure and data workflows that automate certain steps in making data FAIR while meeting publisher and journal requirements. This could include connecting analytical devices to an ELN, automatically converting data to required formats, or implementing an ELN that allows direct data publication in a chemical research data repository, as is the case with the [Chemotion ELN](https://eln.chemotion.net/home) and [Chemotion Repository](https://www.chemotion-repository.net/welcome).

Especially due to their wide breadth of duties, data stewards are constantly involved in networking, exchange, and furthering their own knowledge on RDM approaches, best practices, tools, and services. The RWTH Aachen University, for example, holds a monthly [Open FDM Network Meeting](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/mkbr/file/9-6699/) (in German) geared at data stewards, while state initiatives such as [fdm.nrw](https://www.fdm.nrw/) offer various networking and training opportunities.

There are efforts to better define the role, tasks, and overall career path of data stewards. See the [resources below](#sources-and-further-information) for more information.
